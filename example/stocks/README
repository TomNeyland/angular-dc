How to display the examples in your environment
-----------------------------------------------
First you need an http-server, that you can obtain with

% npm install -g http-server

Then you need to execute that server, on the directory
where you cloned angular-dc.

If you did it in /home/me/github_repos/, and thus you have
the angular-dc project in

 /home/me/github_repos/angular-dc

Execute

% cd /home/me/github_repos
% http-server

Finally, you just need to open the related url, like for example
 http://localhost:8080/angular-dc/example/stocks/nasdaq.html
